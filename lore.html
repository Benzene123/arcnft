      <h3>Prologue</h3>
      <hr>
      <p><em>
        In an uknown solar system, a race of beings known only as The "Ancients", began to explore worlds outside their own homes in hopes of discovering a new home. Their planet was on the brink of destruction due to overutilization, making it increasenly unhabitable. With their scientists desperate for a solution, they began to conceive extreme methods of terraforming candidate planets into replacement. The fruit of this effort was a strange dust-like chemical that could be used to produce the unique gas necessary to make an environment livable for their race.
      </em></p>
      <p><em>
        Three district planets within their local solar system were chosen to receive the gas. After extensive research, it was estimated that the conversion process would take a few hundred years. With this new information they decided to preserve themselves cyrogenically. A few Ancients were selected and tasked with  keeping watch with the help of a few droids. 
      </em></p>
      <p><em>
        Unbeknowest to them, there was one scientist who believed robbing life of other worlds to save their own was unjust. He immediately began to formulate a plan to undermine his fellow Ancients. Believing that the gas would kill off the infected wildlife, he created his own variation that would instead trigger a mutation that would immunity to the disease born out of the gas. He created his own variation that would instead trigger a mutation that would provide immunity to the disease born of the gas. He then developed transmission devices, in the shape of idols, hoping that his variant would give selected beings a chance at defending themselves against The Ancients. He inscribed a message on each  idol and launched a pod to the three different planets 
      </p></em>
      <p><em>Following the path of the first pod, he sent a customized droid. Programmed in its mind was one plan. "Stop The Ancients". </em></p>

       <p> “Before our droids, before our wars, before we truly were the dominating species in the world…there was an ancient civilization that guarded an incredible power. A power so strong that it could easily change the course of history simply by misuse. Our ancestors, in fear of this power being abused, split it into 5 idols and stored each in different parts of the world. Though broken apart, the idols were said to have connections to the spiritual world, and even hosted powerful spirits themselves. These idols stayed hidden for centuries, but power and greed will eventually find them and ignite the great flame that will consume all…”</p>

        <em>“Old Man, what are you mumbling about again? Those fake artifacts and your apocalypse again? Psh, those are just fairy tales. Come back to the real world…”</em>

        The old mysterious rabbit simply grins…<em>"They will be arriving soon."

        “They who??”</em>

        <p> The vault was unlocked to the sound of crickets chirping. There were five empty crates staring back at them . Hokori looked at Tomi and Meisei with disbelief. They all stared at the empty crates with disgust. They proceeded to leave the vault. The artifacts were missing, symbols of great power were no where to be found. Out of the corner of his eye, Tomi spotted markings on the wall and motioned to the rest of the crew.</p>

        <em>"Is that a map?"</em>
        <br>
         <p>It looked like one. There were drawings of what seemed to be mountains and forests . Five markings stood out from the rest of the engravings . They were located at 5 random regions . They scanned the map and set out . 5 artifacts, 5 markings ... Could only mean one thing. </p>

             A few weeks earlier , he had found the last of them. All five artifacts , finally in one place. A man of science, it wasn't easy to believe the existence of magic. Nevertheless, he followed the instructions on the scroll and merged them all . There was a loud explosion as they all came together. He had done it , the stone had been created.

        <div class="five">
           <p> They had arrived. It was an old temple . It seemed deserted but they entered anyway. It had a seemingly unending hall . At the end lay an old monk . He motioned to the three of them to move closer as he sighted them from afar.

            There were more markings on the walls close to him. The drawings looked similar to those they saw at the vault . The monk proceeded to tell the story of the philosopher.
            
            When he was done , he stood up and moved his mat. He led them to the bunker beneath. It looked so futuristic compared to the other parts of the temple.Apparently, it was the philosophers old lab , and the temple was built upon it to hide its existence .He led them to an altar like structure . It looked like a grave as they drew closer . There was a scroll right at the centre. It looked even older than the old man. Hokori reached for it and when he took a closer look, some parts appeared to be burnt. It contained languages long forgotten.
            
            The old man motioned for Hokori to move closer and smiled .</p>

            <em>"They used to laugh at me. They said I was crazy. All my life , I have protected this scroll. Look at it! Those are no ordinary words. I am no adventurer so I never sought the power it contained. But you , you all shall inherit the mantle . Find the idols and use the scroll for great power awaits!"</em>
